		<h4> This is a short biography about myself</h4>
	</div>
	<p>I'm Manish Aryal, Tufts Sophomore from the great mountains of Himalayas. I was born in Nepal at 1997 and am thriving still pretty strong
	at this planet. Most of my time here is spent academically, especailly with Mathematics or Computer Science. I like art and literature too, but it's not my thing. Besides academically, I love to watch and play sports -- soccer, taekwondo, tennis, basketball and hiking. Coming from 
	country of himalays, I love the challenge of uneven and sloppy terrains.</p>
	<!-- Description about my interests and where I am from -->
	<p>I wasn't much of a book reader as a young self, so I'm spending some time readinng and getting into that habit. I belive ideas trigger changes, brings colors to life. I work hard to be a good listener. I'm a huge philosophy fan and generally ponder our existence relative to the universe.
